TruckTrackTamu (Texas A&M Food Truck Tracker Website)

Authors: Michael Anderson, ALex Vo, Diego Torres, Ralph-Oliver Ebongue


This project is a tracker for the food trucks which frequent the Texas A&M College Station campus.

The tracker will keep track of a food truck's name, location, menu, and website.
It also features and interactive map which shows the exact location of food trucks to users. There is also a list view which will list the food trucks rather than showing them on a map.

This project also features a html registration form for food trucks to register their business on our platform.
